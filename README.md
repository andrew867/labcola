## 🧪 About
URL: https://zephyrsai.github.io/labcola/

This project documents the scientific journey to chemically replicate Coca-Cola without using coca leaf extract. Through mass spectrometry analysis, chemical research papers, and countless trials, this recipe achieves a remarkably accurate clone of the world's most famous beverage.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Process Guide**: Step-by-step instructions with expandable sections
- **Complete Ingredient Breakdown**: Exact ratios and volumes for all components
- **Scientific Explanations**: Mass spec analysis, enantiomers, and chemical reactions
- **3D Molecular Visualizations**: Animated representations of key flavor compounds
- **Beautiful UI**: Dark-themed interface with animated bubbles and gradient effects
- **Educational Focus**: Perfect for chemistry students and curious minds

## 🔬 What Makes This Different?

Unlike other cola recipes floating around the internet, Lab-Cola is based on:

- **Mass Spectrometry Data**: Actual GC-MS analysis of authentic Coca-Cola
- **Published Research**: Peer-reviewed journals on cola composition
- **Chemical Accuracy**: Matches the chemical fingerprint of real Coke
- **Blind Taste Tests**: Successfully fooled regular Coke drinkers

## 📋 Recipe Highlights

### The 7X Flavor Oil (100mL batch)
- 45.8 mL Lemon Oil
- 36.5 mL Lime Oil  
- 8 mL Tea Tree Oil
- 4.5 mL Cassia Cinnamon Oil
- 2.7 mL Nutmeg Oil
- And more...

### Key Discoveries
- ✅ **Tannins were the missing ingredient** that made replicas taste like "diet" versions
- ✅ **Tea tree oil** (50% 4-terpineol) mimics coca leaf's fresh notes
- ✅ **Vinegar** (acetic acid) is the 3rd most prominent flavor by mass
- ✅ **Heating is essential** for proper chemical transformations

## ⚠️ Safety & Legal Disclaimer

### Safety First
This recipe involves working with chemicals including:
- 85% phosphoric acid (corrosive)
- Essential oils (concentrated)
- Food-grade alcohol

**Always:**
- Wear gloves and eye protection
- Use glass containers (no metal with phosphoric acid)
- Measure accurately with proper equipment
- Work in well-ventilated areas
- Do NOT taste unmixed ingredients

### Legal Notice
This project is for **educational purposes only**. 

- Coca-Cola® is a registered trademark of The Coca-Cola Company
- This recipe is NOT the official Coca-Cola formula
- Making cola for personal use is legal; commercial use under the Coca-Cola name is not
- The Coca-Cola Company has not patented their recipe (patents require disclosure)

## 📚 Scientific Background

### Mass Spectrometry Analysis
The project utilized two types of mass spectrometers to analyze:
- Authentic Coca-Cola
- Individual essential oils
- Competitor sodas (Pepsi, etc.)
- Progressive recipe iterations

### Key Chemical Compounds Identified
- **α-Terpineol**: Dominant peak, forms from citrus oil breakdown
- **Limonene**: Primary citrus character
- **Cinnamaldehyde**: Cinnamon spice notes
- **4-Terpineol**: Fresh, green notes from tea tree oil
- **Furfural**: From caramel color, adds depth
- **S-Linalool**: Proves coriander is included (not lavender/neroli)

### Chemical Reactions
1. **Sucrose Hydrolysis**: 104g sucrose → ~116g glucose/fructose
2. **Terpene Transformation**: Limonene → α-terpineol (acid-catalyzed)
3. **Ester Formation**: Fructose + heat + acid → ethyl levulinate

## 🎓 Educational Use

This project is perfect for:

- **Chemistry Students**: Real-world application of organic chemistry
- **Science Educators**: Interactive teaching tool for:
  - Mass spectrometry
  - Essential oils and terpenes
  - Acid-base chemistry
  - Formulation science
- **DIY Enthusiasts**: Advanced cooking/beverage making
- **Science Communicators**: Engaging way to discuss analytical chemistry

### ⚗️ Made with Chemistry & Curiosity

*"Dude... I can't even tell. Even though I know already I can't even tell... I wasn't expecting it to taste so much like Coke!"*

**Remember**: This is science, not magic. Stay safe, measure carefully, and enjoy the journey of discovery!

## 🎯 Quick Start for Making Lab-Cola

Want to jump right in? Here's what you need:

### Essential Equipment
- Adjustable micropipette (up to 1000μL)

- Glass containers (no metal!)
- 50mL graduated cylinder
- Heat-resistant glassware
- SodaStream or carbonated water source

### Essential Ingredients
- Essential oils (lemon, lime, orange, tea tree, cinnamon, nutmeg, coriander)
- Fenchol
- Food-grade 95% ethanol
- Caffeine powder
- Glycerin
- 85% phosphoric acid
- Wine tannins
- Caramel color (Shank's brand)
- Cane sugar
- 5% vinegar
- Vanilla extract
